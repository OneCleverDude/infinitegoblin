                <h5>Appearance</h5>
                <p>A goblin is a short, emaciated-seeming goblinoid, about the size of a halfling. They tend to be
                    around three feet tall with large, flat heads and long ears. Their skin tends to be leathery and
                    grey, often wrinkled and covered in tiny scars, warts, and scabs. Goblins grow little, if any,
                    hair, relying on their thick skin and huddling together in groups to keep warm. They have small,
                    beady red eyes set close together over a little pug nose, above a hideously wide mouth lined with
                    sharp little teeth. Goblins often dress in rags and scraps cast off by other humanoids and bear
                    coarsely cobbled-together equipment.</p>
                <p>Many humans and similar races find it hard to distinguish goblin genders, though they do possess
                    reproductive organs. Excessive weight is considered a sign of beauty among female goblins, with
                    the ideal of goblin sexuality being an obese female barghest.</p>
                <h5>Ecology</h5>
                <p>Goblins mature rapidly, reaching adulthood in five years and living up to fifty (though most
                    goblins are violently killed before the age of 20). Goblins' extremely high level of energy comes
                    from both their accelerated metabolism and dangerous lifestyles. Their fast metabolisms make
                    goblins eating machines stricken with almost constant hunger; fortunately, goblins can subsist on
                    almost anything organic. They love salty foods, especially pickled food of all types.</p>
                <h5>Habitat and Society</h5>
                <p>Goblins rarely build their own structures; they prefer to use terrain and natural defenses to their
                    advantage, often settling in areas of heavy undergrowth, easily defensible caves, and ruins. They
                    rely on scavenging for most of their sustenance and are gifted at surviving in even the most
                    hostile climes. Goblins gather in tribes of up to a few dozen, led by a chieftain and sub-chiefs
                    who are simply the toughest individuals in the group. </p>
                <h6>Hatreds</h6>
                <p>Goblins have an near-pathological fear and hatred of horses and dogs, most likely due to the mutual
                    hatred displayed by these animals. Goblins are, in many ways, defined by their fears—not just of
                    dogs and horses but also of humans, and even their religion is based on fear of their gods.
                    Religion holds an important place in most tribes, with complex (and, to outside ears, ridiculous)
                    myths and legends, often fixating on odd-shaped natural features.</p>
                <h6>Love of Treasure</h6>
                <p>Goblins love to collect treasure, but value appearance over utility. Thus, a shiny but worthless
                    trinket is valued over a powerful but ugly magic item. The exception is goblin chieftains, who
                    often possess the wits to make use of such items—if they can remember where they've been stashed.
                    Their love of shiny treasure means that goblins are also a common sight in the refuse pits and
                    junkyards of non-goblin settlements, where they scavenge for items they can craft into weapons and
                    other interesting tools, a task they are unusually proficient in.</p>
